## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

Relational model with four main tables: `User`, `Community`, `Post`, and `Comment`.  
Includes a many-to-many relationship between users and communities (followers/subscribers) implemented via an association table.

### Many-to-Many Relationship

To represent a many-to-many connection (e.g., users following communities), we use an intermediate table. This results in two one-to-many relationships.

## üìù Structured Logging

Structured logging is implemented at the **middleware level**.  
User context (`user_id`, `user_role`) is extracted from JWT tokens in cookies and saved using `ContextVar`.  
This context is automatically added to logs.

### Example Log Output

   "comment_id": 5,
